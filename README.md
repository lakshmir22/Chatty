# Chatty
A decentralized, end-to-end encrypted chat app built with Solidity, React.js, and IPFS. Features smart contract-based authentication, real-time messaging, and secure media storage.

# Decentralized Encrypted Chat App

A decentralized, end-to-end encrypted chat application built using **Solidity**, **React.js**, **Web3.js**, **IPFS**, and **Truffle**. It ensures data ownership and privacy with no central servers.

## üîí Features

- **Privacy-First Architecture**: All messages are encrypted and stored on IPFS. No central authority can access your data.
- **Smart Contracts (Solidity + Truffle)**: Used for user authentication, chat session handling, and access control.
- **IPFS Storage**: Chat history and media files are stored securely and immutably using IPFS.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Seamless one-to-one and group chats with multimedia support.
- **Responsive UI**: Built using React.js for smooth and modern user experience.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Web3.js & Ganache handle blockchain communication and testing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Blockchain**: Solidity, Truffle, Ganache, Web3.js
- **Decentralized Storage**: IPFS
- **Backend/Node Integration**: Node.js (for helper scripts, wallet connections)
